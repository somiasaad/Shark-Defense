                            The screenshot feature supports informed decision-making by providing additional context about the URL:
                            Instant Insight: Users can get an immediate sense of the webpageâ€™s legitimacy and content quality at a glance. This visual context can help users decide whether to trust and proceed with the link.
                            Enhanced Understanding: Screenshots provide a clearer picture of what to expect from a webpage, which is especially useful for identifying misleading or deceptive URLs that may otherwise seem harmless.

                            Seamless Integration: The screenshot is automatically generated and displayed within the detection system, requiring no additional effort from the user.
                            Clear and Accessible: Screenshots are presented in a straightforward manner, making it easy for users of all technical levels to understand and use the information.
